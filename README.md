## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide organizations with an effective and measurable way to evaluate and enhance their Cloud Native security posture. We aim to enable organizations to confidently design, deploy, and operate secure Cloud Native systems through a self-assessment model that drives continuous improvement.

## Overview

The Cloud Native Assurance Maturity Model (CNAMM) is a framework designed to help organizations measure and improve their Cloud Native security and assurance capabilities. This toolkit provides a structured approach to assess your organization's current maturity level and identify areas for improvement.
